# Design Questions

Designing a game is hard, designing a serious game is even harder. When designing a Serious Game, we go through different stages/phases. Firstly, we define the scope of the knowledge to be conveyed, a (more or less) exauhstive list of learning objectives and their underlying instructions and finally the gameplay design choices. In every step, we have a set of questions that should be addressed. 
In this file, we will retrace all those questions and they will be fed to our ontology in order to automate the serious game design process. 

(aim of the current thesis: develop a nice and cool game by asking the right questions and receiving the right answers from an intelligent assistant (aka Ontology)).

# General Questions
- Which fonts and colors should be chosen and why?
- How and to what extent should data be collected about players?
- How should the data be exported? 
- Should cloud save and anonymous athentication be a feature?
- Should authentication via several platforms be possible?
- How should the privacy agreement at the beginning of the game look like?
- Should players be able to choose between different types of atoms like characters?
- Should that have an effect on the story?
- Should the player play a character seperate from themselves or should the character be the representatoion of the player themself?

# Levels
- How many levels should we have in the game?
- How should the player advance to later levels? What's the story?

# Scenes
- The first scene contains/features two instructions from the learning objective list. Is that sufficient, is that overwhelming?
- Should the first scene/level be easier because it is the first one?
- How should the player be introduced to the game? Should it happen in a serperate instructional scene or in the first level?
- How should the Quiz before the first level look like? A rather simple Quiz, where the correct answer has to be pressed, or should the Quiz be designed differently, if yes, why?

# Narrative
- Should there be a narrative?
- If no, why?
- If yes, why and how should it look like?
- Why could a school-like narrative have a negative impact on the game experience?
- What Instructional Design Framework should be used?

# Objectives
- How many objectives should be in one level?
- Should objectives be strictly in one level?

# Quiz
- Should there be a quiz before and after the game?
- Should the questions be multiple choice or true/false and why?
- Should the type of questions be mixed?
- How does the type of question affect the cognitive load/ effort?
